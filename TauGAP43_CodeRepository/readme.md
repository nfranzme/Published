Example code with simulated data to run the major analyses can be run in R statistical software, 
using the R_Tau_GAP43_simulated_data.Rmd Markdown file.
All packages defined in the load libraries chunk must be installed in order to run the code.
The example output of the code can be found in the R_Tau_GAP43_simulated_data.html file.
The run time is about 1 minute in R 4.0.4 on MacOS Mojave.
